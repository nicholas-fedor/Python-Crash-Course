# Tuple - A list of items that cannot change.
# Immutable
# Suitable for storing values that don't change over the lifetime of the program.
# Defined by the presence of a comma; the parenthesis makes them lok neater and more readable.
# If you want to define a tuple with one element, you need to include a trailing comma

# Example: my_t = (3,)
